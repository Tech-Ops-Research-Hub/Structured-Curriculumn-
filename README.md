# Tech Entrepreneurship Curriculum  
## Core Focus: Product Engineering & Incubation Hub

---

## 1. Orientation Layer — Install the Builder Mindset (Week 1)
- Remove assumptions and noise.  
- Train in first-principles product thinking.  
- Introduce incubation rules: speed, iteration, measurable output.  
- Principle: shipped products > ideas.

---

## 2. Product Engineering Foundation (Week 2–4)
**Objective:** Build production-grade MVPs fast.

### Modules
- Software architecture for early-stage systems.  
- Backend: Django, FastAPI, API design, modular structure.  
- Frontend: React.js, Next.js, component systems.  
- Database modeling: relational schemas, indexing, migrations.  
- DevOps basics: Git, CI, deployment pipelines.  
- AI integration: embeddings, LLM workflows, automation hooks.

**Output:** Functional MVP shipped by end of Week 4.

---

## 3. User Research and Validation Engine (Week 5–6)
- Identify real users and real pain.  
- Rapid-feedback loops: prototype → user → revise.  
- Measure activation, retention, willingness to pay.

**Output:** Validated problem + validated solution direction.

---

## 4. Product Incubation Sprint 1 — Build the Real Version (Week 7–10)
- Full engineering sprint under hub constraints.  
- Weekly shipping cycles.  
- Standups focused on blockers only.  
- Enforce clean architecture and modularity.  
- UI/UX: frictionless workflow execution.

**Output:** MVP v1.0 in production with real user activity.

---

## 5. Customer Acquisition Pipeline (Week 11–13)
- Integrate demand channels directly into product.  
- Automated onboarding, referral loops, email flows.  
- Cold outreach engineering for B2B.  
- Content systems for B2C.  
- A/B testing and instrumentation.

**Output:** First 100–500 users.

---

## 6. Product Incubation Sprint 2 — Traction and Monetization (Week 14–18)
- Convert usage → revenue.  
- Payment and billing integration.  
- Pricing experiments.  
- Retention loop engineering.  
- Metrics dashboards.

**Output:** Real revenue.

---

## 7. Scaling Systems for Early-Stage Tech (Week 19–22)
- Infrastructure scaling patterns.  
- Codebase hardening.  
- Automate operations.  
- Customer success frameworks.  
- Revenue engine optimization.

**Output:** Product stable under growth load.

---

## 8. Founder Systems Training (Week 23–26)
- Execution frameworks and deep-work structure.  
- Team design and operational roles.  
- Documentation discipline.  
- Legal, compliance, IP, data protection.

**Output:** Company-ready operational system.

---

## 9. Investment, Partnerships, and Growth Expansion (Week 27–30)
- Investor-grade pitch, traction story, financial model.  
- Partnership and distribution leverage.  
- Negotiation fundamentals.  
- Expansion strategy: markets, segments, adjacent products.

**Output:** Investor-ready startup with measurable traction.

---

## 10. Graduation Requirements
Graduates leave with:

1. Launched product with active users.  
2. Working acquisition engine.  
3. Revenue-producing model.  
4. Investor-ready pitch deck.  
5. Documented technical architecture.  
6. Team operating under incubation systems.
